	<h2>The Design of our Website</h2>
		<h3> Our designs for this website was to be simple, clean, and nice to look at. Our target group is for people that suffer with mental health issues and people that could get easily overwhelmed. We wanted to create a calming feel when looking at the sight with nothing that contrasts too dramatic or that could be overly vibrant. We kept the same font throughout the website to ensure consistency but made sure there was a difference between sub-headers and paragraphs using italics. </h3>

		<h3> Here we have the homepage and the "About Us" Wireframes. We want to have a clear overview of the whole website, hence why we put all the accessible options in the top left bar. Visitors can easily and quickly navigate through the site to find what they are looking for. On the about us page we want to make clear who are behind the website, design, concept and marketing of the product we are promoting. People will then see our faces and will feel more familiar and connected to us and our brand.&nbsp; <br><br><br>

	<h4>The Visual Design</h4>
	<h5> These are the colors we used for this brand development website. We chose red because it is a bright, noticable color and it is really out there. Gold and black were chosen because they look dangerous, mysterious and yet very appealing.<br><br>
				The font chosen for this was Helvetica because it is fun, bold, and in your face. It differs from other fonts, just like our drink distanciates itself from other energy drinks because of the message, goal and overall look and feel. It reflects our excitement and the boost you will receive from NRG! </h5>

	<h2>User Testing report</h2><br>
		<h3> <br><br>
		<br>
		We gave out our drinks to random people on the streets , aged between 18 and 60, to let them test. We received positive feedback on our color choice regarding packaging. When it comes to taste, they told us that it is very distinguished and different from other brands. It does not have the typical energy drink taste, and is rather fruity but not too sweet, which is seen as positive. <br><br>
			
		We sent our website to 15 people. The question we asked when sending the website, was; "What do or don't you like about this website and why?" Overall, everyone liked the bold colors as it matches the packaging and it is recognizable. The texts are very clear and give a good view of the meaning and goals behind NRG. The website is also very easy to navigate which is a big plus. <br><br>
			
		As point of improvement, we got the feedback that more information could be added, a link to purchase the product would come in handy and maybe it would be a good idea to mention more client reviews on the website. <br><br>
